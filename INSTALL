Building MPIPerf
----------------

Unpack the tar file and go to the top level directory

    $ tar zxvf mpiperf.tar.gz
    $ cd mpiperf

Before building specify your compiler and path to MPI library in Makefile.inc. 
To compile MPIPerf, type

    $ make 

If no error occurs, executable file src/mpiperf will be created.

Checking timers
---------------

Before any measurements it is required to check timers in MPIPerf on target 
computer system. To print list of supported timers run mpiperf with option -T

    $ mpiexec -n 1 ./mpiperf -T
    Supported timers:
    MPI_Wtime
    gettimeofday
    tsc

To check timer 'tsc' run mpiperf with option -j (default timer is MPI_Wtime)

    $ mpiexec -n 1 ./mpiperf -j -t tsc

In the case of correct work of timer the message "PASSED" is printed.

Checking synchronization
------------------------

To checking correctness of synchronization of processes run WaitPatternNull 
test on few nodes

    $ mpiexec -n 64 ./mpiperf WaitPatternNull

The execution time of test (column [Mean]) must be 0.XX microseconds. 
Value greater then 1.00 microseconds indicates invalid synchronization of 
processes. In such case you can try to check other timers:

    $ mpiexec -n 64 ./mpiperf -t tsc WaitPatternNull

Running tests
-------------

To print list of support tests run mpiperf with option -q

    $ ./mpiperf -q

To run test 'Bcast'

    $ mpiexec -n 16 ./mpiperf Bcast

In following example data size (count) is changed from 1024 bytes to 64 KiB in 
a geometric progression with common ration 2:

    $ mpiexec -n 32 ./mpiperf -t tsc -x1024 -X64KiB -S2 Bcast

In following example number of processes is changed from 1 to 16 in an 
arithmetic progression with common difference 1, data size (count) is changed 
from 1024 to 8 KiB in an arithmetic progression with common difference 1024:

    $ mpiexec -n 32 ./mpiperf -p1 -P16 -g1 -x1KiB -X8KiB -s1024 Bcast

In following example each test is terminated when relative standard error 
of measured time is less then 3% or number of test runs is greater then 1000:

    $ mpiexec -n 32 ./mpiperf -x2MiB -X4MiB -S2 -R1000 -e3 Scatter

In following example MPI_Ibarrier time is measured 
in blockig mode (MPI_Ibarrier followed by MPI_Wait):

    $ mpiexec -n 32 ./mpiperf -x1 -X1 -b ibarrier

In following example MPI_Iallgather overlap is measured:

    $ mpiexec -n 64 ./mpiperf -x1 -X1024 -S2 iallgather 
 
Plotting graphs
---------------

Gnuplot scripts for plotting are located in directory examples/graphs.
